# GPT-2 Plays League of Legends

The goal of this project is to recreate a chat log of a League of Legends game using the GPT-2 neural network.

## Data

The model was trained on a set of in-game chat logs, taken from the Tribunal, a no longer operational attempt at a crowd sourced player behavior management system. I downloaded the data from [Sim Sheng Xue on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/simshengxue/league-of-legends-tribunal-chatlogs) who did not specify how they managed to get their hands on the data in the first place.
